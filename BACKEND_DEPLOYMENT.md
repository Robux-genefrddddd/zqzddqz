# Backend Deployment Guide - Netlify & Vercel

## Overview

Your backend has been configured to work with both **Netlify** and **Vercel** using serverless functions. This guide covers both deployment options.

---

## Architecture

Your app uses:
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (SPA)
- **Backend**: Express.js
- **Download API**: `/api/download` (NEW - CORS proxy)

The backend is deployed as **serverless functions** on both platforms:
- **Netlify**: Uses `netlify/functions/api.ts` with `serverless-http`
- **Vercel**: Uses `api/index.ts` with `serverless-http`

---

## Netlify Deployment ✅ (Currently Configured)

### Status
✅ **Already configured** - `netlify.toml` is set up

### What's Set Up
- `netlify.toml` defines the build and function settings
- `netlify/functions/api.ts` wraps Express with `serverless-http`
- API rewrites: `/api/*` → `/.netlify/functions/api/*`
- Frontend: Built to `dist/spa`

### Deploy to Netlify

**Option 1: Connect GitHub Repository**
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Click "New Site from Git"
3. Select your GitHub repository
4. Settings will auto-use `netlify.toml`
5. Click "Deploy Site"

**Option 2: Deploy via CLI**
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Verify Netlify Deployment
- Frontend loads at: `https://your-site.netlify.app`
- API works at: `https://your-site.netlify.app/api/download`
- Test download: Try downloading an asset, should work without CORS errors ✅

---

## Vercel Deployment ✅ (Ready to Deploy)

### Status
✅ **Configured** - Ready to deploy
- `vercel.json` defines build and rewrite settings
- `api/index.ts` wraps Express with `serverless-http`

### What's Set Up
- `vercel.json` configures serverless functions
- `api/` directory contains the handler
- API rewrites: `/api/*` → `/api` handler
- Frontend: Built to `dist/spa`

### Deploy to Vercel

**Option 1: Connect GitHub Repository**
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select your GitHub repository
4. Vercel auto-detects settings from `vercel.json`
5. Click "Deploy"

**Option 2: Deploy via CLI**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Verify Vercel Deployment
- Frontend loads at: `https://your-project.vercel.app`
- API works at: `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/download`
- Test download: Try downloading an asset, should work without CORS errors ✅

## Configuration Comparison

| Feature | Netlify | Vercel |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Config File** | `netlify.toml` | `vercel.json` |
| **Backend Location** | `netlify/functions/` | `api/` |
| **API Rewrite** | `/api/*` → `/.netlify/functions/api/*` | `/api/*` → `/api` |
| **Node Runtime** | `nodejs20.x` (default) | `nodejs20.x` |
| **Max Duration** | 26 seconds (free) | 60 seconds |
| **Serverless HTTP** | ✅ Configured | ✅ Configured |
| **CORS Proxy** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |

---

## Important Notes

### 1. Serverless Constraints
Both platforms have limitations:
- **Max request size**: ~6-10 MB
- **Max function duration**: 26-60 seconds
- **Environment variables**: Set in platform settings

### 2. Firebase Credentials
Your Firebase config is **public** (API keys) - this is normal for client-side Firebase.
- Ensure your Firestore/Storage rules are properly set (done ✅)
- The backend uses `serverless-http` which is stateless - no session storage

### 3. CORS Download Endpoint
The `/api/download` endpoint:
- Fetches files from Firebase Storage
- Works from any origin (no CORS issues!)
- Returns file with proper headers
- Works on both Netlify and Vercel ✅

---

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying

- [ ] Firebase Storage rules are deployed (`storage.rules` → Publish)
- [ ] Environment variables are set (if needed)
- [ ] Code builds locally: `npm run build`
- [ ] Tests pass: `npm run test` (optional)

### Deploy Netlify
```bash
# Option 1: Via GitHub (auto-deploy on push)
# Just push to GitHub, Netlify auto-deploys from netlify.toml

# Option 2: Via CLI
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Deploy Vercel
```bash
# Option 1: Via GitHub (auto-deploy on push)
# Just push to GitHub, Vercel auto-deploys from vercel.json

# Option 2: Via CLI
vercel --prod
```

### After Deploying

- [ ] Test homepage loads
- [ ] Test asset listing works
- [ ] Test asset detail page works
- [ ] **Test download**: Click download button on any asset
  - Should NOT show CORS errors
  - File should download successfully ✅

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: /api/download returns 404

**On Netlify:**
- Check `netlify.toml` has redirect: `from = "/api/*"` → `to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat"`
- Verify `netlify/functions/api.ts` exists and exports handler

**On Vercel:**
- Check `vercel.json` has rewrite: `source: "/api/(.*)"` → `destination: "/api"`
- Verify `api/index.ts` exists and exports default handler

### Issue: Downloads still have CORS errors

- Check backend endpoint is actually being called (DevTools → Network)
- Verify frontend uses `/api/download` (not direct Firebase URL)
- Check browser console for actual error messages

### Issue: Firebase files not found

- Verify Storage rules allow read access
- Confirm files are actually uploaded to Firebase Storage
- Check Firebase Console → Storage for files

### Issue: Large files fail to download

Vercel has a 6 MB max response size for serverless functions. For larger files, consider:
1. Compress files before uploading
2. Use streaming (more complex)
3. Use Vercel Pro with higher limits

---

## Environment Variables (if needed)

If you add environment variables, configure them in:

**Netlify:**
- Settings → Environment variables
- Or add to `netlify.toml`:
```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_ENV = "production"
```

**Vercel:**
- Settings → Environment Variables
- Or use `.env.production.local` (for local testing only)

## Files Reference

| File | Purpose | Platform |
|------|---------|----------|
| `netlify.toml` | Build config | Netlify |
| `netlify/functions/api.ts` | Serverless handler | Netlify |
| `vercel.json` | Build config | Vercel |
| `api/index.ts` | Serverless handler | Vercel |
| `server/index.ts` | Express app | Both |
| `server/routes/download.ts` | Download endpoint | Both |
| `client/lib/fileService.ts` | Frontend download | Both |
